ttt001
The ID of the preceding item after which the new item will be inserted. If not set, the new item will be appended to the end of the conversation. If set to root, the new item will be added to the beginning of the conversation. If set to an existing ID, it allows an item to be inserted mid-conversation. If the ID cannot be found, an error will be returned and the item will not be added.

            }
        ]
    }
}
conversation.item.truncate
Send this event to truncate a previous assistant messageâ€™s audio. The server will produce audio faster than realtime, so this event is useful when the user interrupts to truncate audio that has already been sent to the client but not yet played. This will synchronize the server's understanding of the audio with the client's playback.

Truncating audio will delete the server-side text transcript to ensure there is not text in the context that hasn't been heard by the user.

If successful, the server will respond with a conversation.item.truncated event.

audio_end_ms
integer
Inclusive duration up to which audio is truncated, in milliseconds. If the audio_end_ms is greater than the actual audio duration, the server will respond with an error.
content_index
integer
The index of the content part to truncate. Set this to 0.

Send this event when you want to remove any item from the conversation history. The server will respond with a conversation.item.deleted event, unless the item does not exist in the conversation history, in which case the server will respond with an error.

response.create
This event instructs the server to create a Response, which means triggering model inference. When in Server VAD mode, the server will create Responses automatically.

A Response will include at least one Item, and may have two, in which case the second will be a function call. These Items will be appended to the conversation history.

The server will respond with a response.created event, events for Items and content created, and finally a response.done event to indicate the Response is complete.

The response.create event includes inference configuration like instructions, and temperature. These fields will override the Session's configuration for this Response only.

conversation.item.created
Returned when a conversation item is created. There are several scenarios that produce this event:

The server is generating a Response, which if successful will produce either one or two Items, which will be of type message (role assistant) or type function_call.
The input audio buffer has been committed, either by the client or the server (in server_vad mode). The server will take the content of the input audio buffer and add it to a new user message Item.
The client has sent a conversation.item.create event to add a new Item to the Conversation.

            }
        ]
    }
}
conversation.item.input_audio_transcription.completed
This event is the output of audio transcription for user audio written to the user audio buffer. Transcription begins when the input audio buffer is committed by the client or server (in server_vad mode). Transcription runs asynchronously with Response creation, so this event may come before or after the Response events.

Realtime API models accept audio natively, and thus input transcription is a separate process run on a separate ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition) model, currently always whisper-1. Thus the transcript may diverge somewhat from the model's interpretation, and should be treated as a rough guide.

conversation.item.truncated
Returned when an earlier assistant audio message item is truncated by the client with a conversation.item.truncate event. This event is used to synchronize the server's understanding of the audio with the client's playback.

input_audio_buffer.speech_started
Sent by the server when in server_vad mode to indicate that speech has been detected in the audio buffer. This can happen any time audio is added to the buffer (unless speech is already detected). The client may want to use this event to interrupt audio playback or provide visual feedback to the user.

The client should expect to receive a input_audio_buffer.speech_stopped event when speech stops. The item_id property is the ID of the user message item that will be created when speech stops and will also be included in the input_audio_buffer.speech_stopped event (unless the client manually commits the audio buffer during VAD activation).
